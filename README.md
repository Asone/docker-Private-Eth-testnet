This repo intends to provide docker configurations relative to ethereum environment. Specs are still `WIP`, but below are some ideas of what could be provided : 

- [ ] Single & simple geth ethereum node.
- [ ] Ganache-cli service + Truffle boilerplate
- [ ] PoA node + dashboard
- [ ] Single PoA node
- [ ] PoA node + Clixplorer
- [ ] Genesis generation with Puppeth ? 

When the different scopes will be defined, this README will be rewritten.
